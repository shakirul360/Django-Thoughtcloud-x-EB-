The idea came to be when I realized how quickly I forget my daily thoughts and needed notes to keep a hold of them. Since I learnt Python very recently and was excited to try out my newly acquired skills, I made my very own web-app. Pushing it further for my ever-long curiosity about the web and having the time to spare before I start my freshman year, I tried to learn how to deploy Django web-apps and came across Amazon Web Services and was able to successfully deploy it for free.

Amazon Web Services used - 1) Elastik Beanstalk
                           2) Amazon RDS mySQL

Hopefully, I will be able to create a better version of this after gaining knowledge of JavaScript.

EDIT -- After learning basic JavaScript and Jquery, I implemented Edit and Delete options for each Thought(data) in Version 2.0. Stack Overflow was instrumental throughout the implementation of my new skills.
